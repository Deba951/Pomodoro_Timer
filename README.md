What is a Pomodoro Timer?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a Pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student. -- Wikipedia


In simple words, a Pomodoro timer is a simple app that helps us to focus and be productive. It schedules alternate work and breaks sessions.


Users should be able to:

1) Start the timer by clicking on the 'START' link/button.
2) Once the user clicks start, the word start will change to STOP. Then, the user can ...click on the 'STOP' button to make the timer stop.
3) Click on the Gear icon to change the length (minutes and seconds) of the timer.
4) Once the timer finishes, the ring should change from red to green.
5) Can use any frameworks, libraries, tools or can stay with good old CSS and Vanilla JS.
